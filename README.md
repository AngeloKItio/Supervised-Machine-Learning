The dataset was collected from the Kaggle dataset library. The dataset's main goal is to predict whether a loan application will be approved or rejected based on particular features.

The loan approval dataset is a set of financial records and related data used to assess a person's or organization's suitability for a loan from a lending institution. It takes into account a number of variables, including the cibil score, income, employment situation, loan length, loan amount, asset worth, and loan status.

Almost everyone in the country has already applied for a loan at least once, therefore it's critical to understand what criteria actually influence a loan application's outcome.

The data set has 4269 rows with 13 columns, the lat column being the target variable. Here is a link to access the data set and below are some codes to look at the data set.
